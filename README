Example_00 - This is just a blink LED example by Core 0. Move ahead to next examples!

Example_01 - Each core blinks its corresponding LED.

Example_02 - 4 Cores blinks the ACT_OK LED one after the other. Count of the blink represents which core is blinking the LED. Core 0 will blink the LED 1 time then Core 1 will blink the LED 2 times and so on..

Example_03 - Core 1,2,3 tries to write in a same RAM location. Core 0 monitors who won in writing and blinks the ACT_OK LED based on it. Also Core 0 sends the data via UART.
